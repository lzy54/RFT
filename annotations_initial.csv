cox_ph,"Train a Cox proportional hazards (Cox-PH / DeepSurv) survival model on the
METABRIC breast cancer dataset using the provided training and validation splits.

Data structure:
- cox_ph/cox_ph_metabric_train.csv
- cox_ph/cox_ph_metabric_val.csv
- cox_ph/cox_ph_metabric_test.csv

Each CSV contains covariates x0窶度8, a duration column, and an event indicator.

Task requirements:
1. Train a Cox proportional hazards model using the training data.
2. Use the validation split for model selection or early stopping.
3. Generate risk predictions for the test split.
4. Save predictions to:
   - ./pred_results/cox_ph_predictions.csv

The output CSV must contain the input covariates x0窶度8 together with a predicted
risk score for each test example.
